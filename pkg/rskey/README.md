# rskey

[rskey](https://github.com/rstudio/rskey) is a command-line tool (and bundled
Go package) that generates secret keys interoperable with the format used by
RStudio's Connect and Package Manager products.

It can be used to help manage secrets without the need to install these products
first, and is designed for use in Infrastructure-as-Code and containerised
deployments of these products.

See https://github.com/rstudio/rskey for more details.
