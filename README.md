# RStudio Platform Go Libraries

## Overview

This repo includes useful Go code for building applications.

## Go Directories

### `/internal`

Private application and library code. This is the code you don't want others importing in their applications or libraries. Note that this layout pattern is enforced by the Go compiler itself. See the Go 1.4 [`release notes`](https://golang.org/doc/go1.4#internalpackages) for more details. Note that you are not limited to the top level `internal` directory. You can have more than one `internal` directory at any level of your project tree.

You can optionally add a bit of extra structure to your internal packages to separate your shared and non-shared internal code. It's not required (especially for smaller projects), but it's nice to have visual clues showing the intended package use. Your actual application code can go in the `/internal/app` directory (e.g., `/internal/app/myapp`) and the code shared by those apps in the `/internal/pkg` directory (e.g., `/internal/pkg/myprivlib`).

### `/pkg`

Library code that's ok to use by external applications (e.g., `/pkg/mypubliclib`). Other projects will import these libraries expecting them to work, so think twice before you put something here.

### `/vendor`

Application dependencies managed by [`Go Modules`](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) feature). The `go mod vendor` command will create the `/vendor` directory for you.

Don't commit your application dependencies if you are building a library.

## Common Application Directories

### `/scripts`

Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations.

These scripts keep the root level `justfile` small and simple (e.g., [`https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/Makefile`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/Makefile)).

### `/test`

Additional external test apps and test data.

## Other Directories

### `/docs`

Design and user documents (in addition to your godoc generated documentation).

### `/examples`

Examples for your applications and/or public libraries.
